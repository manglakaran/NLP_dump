Each folder contains the three python files and their corresponding outputs for the three cases - 

  1. With removing stop words from 250 feature words
  2. Without removing stop words from 250 feature words
  3. With taking top 50 most occurring unigrams as stop words and not including them as feature words.

The *.py takes the dataset as input and after the tokens and the unigrams as produced , it gives the corresponding 50 clusters as output.
